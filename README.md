# Sweet Shop Tests

- This repository has some test cases i made for this website: https://sweetshop.netlify.app
- For now these were the errors i found on the website

# Errors found

1 - When added to the basket, several names of products change inside the basket, this probably would confuse some users when buying sweets in the store if it was a real store.


2 - The image for the product 'Wham Bars' is not loading correctly.


3 - It's currently not possible to enter the "about" page from the basket page because there's no element with href="about" in it

# Tests planned (✔️: Done / ❌: Not Done)

✔️ - Test if all the images of the sweets on the sweets page are being loaded correctly

✔️ - Test if all sweets are added correctly to the basket when you press their respective "Add to Basket" buttons

✔️ - Test if you can open the "About" page from the basket page

✔️ - Test if you can open the "About" page from the sweets page

❌ - Test if you can open the "About" page from the login page

❌ - Test if you can open the "About" page from the first page

❌ - Test if you can open the "About" page from the about page
